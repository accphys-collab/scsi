Introduction
============

glps is a general lattice parser for accelerator description files.

The general means it does not fix the reserved keywords, and its user can define his own set of keywords.

glps parse the following structures:

1. assignment

    A = 3;
    B = (1,2,3);
    QF.L = 4;
    QD.L = QF.L * 2;

2. element definition

    Element: Type, property = value [, property = value] ;
    
3. beam line definition

    L1: LINE = (element, -element, (element1, element2));
    L2: LINE = (L1, -L1);

4. action

    action, property = value [, property = value] ;


Notes
======

glps tries its best to preserve the structure information in its final
expaned beam line. An element (EL1) placed in a beam line (BL1) which is part of
another beam line (BL2) is represented as BL2.BL1.EL1.

The reverse sign before an element or beamline is preserved, in case the
user wants to treat entrance of an element different from the exit.

several lattice file can use "include" action to be glued together. (did
not detect the infinite loop, but has a maximum depth limit on "include").
